This project contains the Ruby in_array gem. This is perhaps the tiniest gem
ever created. It allows all objects to respond to the :in_array method that
encapsulates the object in an array unless it is already an array. So

  'Hello'.in_array    ====> ['Hello']
  ['Hello'].in_array  ====> ['Hello']
  my_object.in_array  ====> [my_object]
  [1,2,3].in_array    ====> [1,2,3]
